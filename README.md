We chose to work with multiple datasets covering various aspects of COVID-19 to gain a holistic understanding of the pandemic’s impact. Each dataset focuses on a different topic—tests, hospital admissions, and case data—which allows us to explore the pandemic from multiple dimensions:

Percent of NYC residents tested who tested positive(Dataset 1):
This dataset includes columns like total_test, positive_test, percent_positive, percent_positive_7days_agg, and UptDate. It provides information on the number of tests conducted, the positivity rate, and aggregated weekly positivity percentages. This data helps us analyze testing coverage, trends in positive cases, and how testing rates fluctuated over time.

Number of people admitted to NYC hospital for covid-19(Dataset 2):
Key columns are ili_pne_admit (admissions for influenza-like and pneumonia conditions), baseline, percent_change, status, and ETLdate. This dataset tracks hospital admissions related to respiratory illnesses, which often coincide with COVID-19 outbreaks. The data provides context on healthcare system strain during the pandemic and how admissions varied in response to virus surges.

Daily counts of Cases, Hospitalization and Deaths(Dataset 3):
This dataset includes CASE_COUNT, PROBABLE_CASE_COUNT, HOSPITALIZED_COUNT, DEATH_COUNT, and 7-day averages (CASE_COUNT_7DAY_AVG, ALL_CASE_COUNT_7DAY_AVG, HOSP_COUNT_7DAY_AVG, DEATH_COUNT_7DAY_AVG). It covers confirmed and probable cases, hospitalizations, and deaths due to COVID-19, along with rolling averages. This data helps assess the severity of the pandemic, tracking confirmed infections, and monitoring trends in hospitalization and mortality rates over time.
These datasets provide a comprehensive view of the pandemic, capturing essential aspects from testing to healthcare impact and outcomes. Analyzing them together allows us to understand how testing influenced case detection, how case surges impacted hospital systems, and the overall severity and trends of COVID-19. This multi-dimensional approach enriches our analysis, giving us a more complete picture of the pandemic’s dynamics.

When combined, these datasets enable a holistic analysis of the pandemic. By examining correlations between testing rates, hospitalizations, case numbers, and death rates, we gain deeper insights into the effectiveness of interventions and public health strategies. For example, a surge in positive tests followed by increased hospitalizations and deaths could indicate gaps in preventive measures, while a decline in these could suggest successful containment. Overall, this integrated approach helps paint a more complete picture of the COVID-19 pandemic, supporting evidence-based decisions to protect public health.

Description:

# **Challenges**

**Challenge 1: Handling Missing Values**

**Solution:** Missing values can disrupt the analysis and model training. To handle this, you can:

1. Impute values using the mean or median for numerical data.
2. Forward fill or backward fill for time-series data, filling gaps with the previous or next available data.
3. Remove rows with excessive missing values if they’re not critical.

**Challenge 2: Outliers Affecting Data Quality**

**Solution:** Outliers can distort trends and predictions. To handle outliers, you can:

1. Identify outliers using Z-scores or IQR.
2. Cap values or Winsorize extreme values to reduce their impact.
3. Log-transform data to make the distribution more normal.

**Challenge 3: Data Inconsistencies Across Time Periods**

**Solution:** When dealing with time-series data, different formats or irregular intervals can cause inconsistencies. To address this:

1. Standardize date formats and ensure consistency across the dataset.
2. Reindex the data to fill missing time periods with appropriate values, like forward filling or interpolation.


**Future stepse**


Step 1: Predictive Modeling

This step involves building machine learning models to gain deep insights from data. These insights can then be applied to real-world situations to make informed decisions.

Step 2: Adding Transportation Data

In this step, transportation data is incorporated into the analysis. This data can reveal insights about how people travel from one place to another. This information can be valuable for organizations that are considering hybrid work models, which combine remote work with in-person office work.

Step 3: Identifying Global Supply Chain Disruptions

This step focuses on identifying disruptions in global supply chains. These disruptions can be caused by various factors, such as factory closures, port congestion, and transportation bottlenecks.

Overall Context

While the image doesn't provide a specific context, these steps seem to be part of an analysis related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has led to significant changes in the way people work and how goods are transported globally. By using data and predictive modeling, organizations can better understand and respond to these changes.

Specific Examples

Here are some examples of how these steps might be applied:

Step 1: A company might use predictive modeling to forecast demand for its products based on historical sales data and other relevant factors.
Step 2: A city government might use transportation data to identify areas where public transportation is congested and implement solutions to improve traffic flow.
Step 3: A logistics company might use data to identify potential supply chain disruptions and develop contingency plans to minimize their impact.
Additional Considerations

It's important to note that data quality and privacy are crucial when implementing these steps. Organizations need to ensure that the data they use is accurate and reliable, and that they comply with relevant data privacy regulations.
